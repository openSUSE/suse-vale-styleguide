# Vale-based technical documentation style guide

A [Vale](https://vale.sh)-compatible style for technical writers documenting open source software and for anyone writing about Open Source.
The style guide closely follows the [SUSE Documentation Style Guide](https://documentation.suse.com/style/current/html/docu_styleguide/index.html)
and is developed by the SUSE Documentation Team.

## Checks

The supplied rules perform the following checks:

- common language usage errors
- punctuation
- editorializing
- wordiness
- terminology
- corporate speak
- inclusive language

# Installation on Linux

The following installation procedure has been tested on Linux Mint and openSUSE.


## Option 1. Install precompiled binary

1. Check the available tags at https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/tags
2. Use wget to download the latest tag, for example:

```shell
wget https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/releases/download/v2.20.0/vale_2.20.0_Linux_64-bit.tar.gz
```
3. Create a _vale_ subdirectory in your home directory and extract the downloaded archive there:

```shell
test -d ~/vale || mkdir ~/vale
tar xvf vale*.tar.gz -C ~/vale
```
4. Add ``vale`` to `PATH` by adding the directory to .bashrc and reload it:
```shell
echo 'export PATH=~/vale:"$PATH"' >> .bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Instead of _~/vale_, you can move the binary to any directory that is in `$PATH`.


## Option 2. Install distribution provided binary

vale is widely packaged by the distribution providers, so install it for
your distribution if provided in a recent enough version. Please check the packaging status:

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/vale.svg)](https://repology.org/project/vale/versions)


For example in openSUSE Leap 15.5 or newer, `vale` can be installed by issuing:

```shell
zypper install vale
```


## Option 3. Install via Brew

1. Install [Brew](https://brew.sh):
```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Install Vale:
```shell
brew install vale
```

# Install the style guide rules

1. Create the _styles_ directory: `mkdir ~/styles`
2. Clone the Git repository: `cd ~/styles && git clone  https://github.com/openSUSE/suse-vale-styleguide.git`

## Create configuration file

Create a configuration file in your home directory:

```shell
nano ~/.vale.ini
```
Add the following configuration:

```yaml
StylesPath = styles
MinAlertLevel = suggestion
[asciidoctor]
experimental = YES
[*{xml,adoc,md}]
BasedOnStyles = common
```

3. Save the changes.

## Add DocBook-XML and AsciiDoc support (openSUSE)

1. Install the _libxslt-tools_ and _docbook-xsl-stylesheets_ packages.
2. Open the _.vale.ini_ file for editing and update the existing configuration as follows:

```yaml
StylesPath = styles
MinAlertLevel = suggestion
[asciidoctor]
experimental = YES
[*.xml]
Transform = /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/suse2022-ns/xhtml/docbook.xsl
BasedOnStyles = common, docbook
[*.adoc]
BasedOnStyles = common, asciidoc
[*.{xml,adoc,md}]
BasedOnStyles = common
```

3. Save the changes.

## Add XML support (Linux Mint)

1. Install the _docbook5-xml_ and _docbook-xsl_ packages.
2. Open the _.vale.ini_ file for editing and update the existing configuration as follows:

```yaml
StylesPath = styles
MinAlertLevel = suggestion
[asciidoctor]
experimental = YES
[*.xml]
Transform = /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/nwalsh/html/docbook.xsl
BasedOnStyles = common, docbook
[*{xml,adoc,md}]
BasedOnStyles = common
```

3. Save the changes.

## Add VS Code and VSCodium integration

In VS Code, install the [Vale +VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChrisChinchilla.vale-vscode).
In VSCodium, install [Vale +VS Code extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/chrischinchilla/vale-vscode).

[Source code](https://github.com/ChrisChinchilla/vale-vscode)

In VS Code or VSCodium, choose **File > Preferences > Settings** and specify the path to the Vale binary (for example, _/usr/local/bin/vale_) under **Vale > Vale CLI: Path**.
